# Planning

## Root Home Page
- It should have some sort of game or fun thing. Showing my skills off.
- The content of this page is still a bit of a question mark. Could also just be my recent posts. But i like the idea of just a silly little experiment.
- Had a different navigation at least on mobile that has more focus on navigation, getting the user into the content more quickly.

## Blog Section
- Blog section will have a more traditional blog layout, with header and teaser content.

## Work Section
- Work section will have a landing page that has more imagery in the listing of content.

## About Section

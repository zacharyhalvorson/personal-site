            p My background in teaching has motivated me to begin work on this project. It's a tool for planning, managing and sharing lesson plans. I started with the idea and went from there, asking myself all the Why questions I could before starting to sketch.

                p From sketches I began to create a userflow and wireframes.
                p Once the information architecture and wireframing process was complete I started with the visual design process, originally starting with an iPad-centric experience in mind.

                p Teachers use their desktop computers, their iPads, smartboards and whatever interfaces they can get their hands on to teach a lesson so it made more sense to start developing a responsive web app. Being able to use the app from anywhere is a must for the user.
                p The following iterations brought me to the final mockups I have begun to use for the prototype development.

            .image-carousel
                .m-scooch.m-scooch-photos.m-fluid
                    .m-scooch-inner
                        .m-item: img(src="/img/curriculate/screens/dashboard.png")
                        .m-item: img(src="/img/curriculate/screens/no-lessons.png")
                        .m-item: img(src="/img/curriculate/screens/profile.png")
                        .m-item: img(src="/img/curriculate/screens/login.png")
                    .m-scooch-controls
                        a(href="" data-m-slide="prev"): img(src="/img/arrow-prev.svg")
                        a(href="" data-m-slide="next"): img(src="/img/arrow-next.svg")

            p The project is still early in the development stage, I'll hopefully have something live linked here soon.

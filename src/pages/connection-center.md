The Connection Center is a responsive web application built to enable targetted marketing for e-commerce retailers using Mobify’s platform with web or native apps.
My work on this project ranged from strategy work, and low fidelity UX design, to prototyping, and front-end implementation. I was involved in the initial concept work, and helped develop the React prototype we used to prove out the business case.

As the Connection Center is a single page app, transitions are something we focussed on to give the UI a polished, solid feel. Establishing trust with our users was key if they were to commit their customer communications with us.

As this project matures, we’ve looked at refining the colour palette to be more flexible. Reducing the aesthetic use of colour, and focussing on establishing heirarchy through spacing and typography.

## What Did I learn?

This project was my first time working with a team to take a concept, and develop it into a viable product. Building prototypes to test if we’re going down the right track. Finding the right balance of desirable features, with feasible timelines. It was overall an exercise in how to ship something new. I was lucky to work with a talented team, and am happy with the result.

This project..

## What did I learn?
- This was my first introduction to designing and launching a native application. 
- My introduction to hybrid tech. 
- My first Android experience.

## Why would I not want to show this?
- The UI is the dog’s breakfast
- Beyond the Rack is just kind of a shitty brand.

## What would this project show about me?
- That I have a launched app in the Play store
- That I have experience working on native application, I did work in Android Studio after all…
- That I’m a prototyper and a fast learner

## What should I actually show?

> Framer Prototypes Of Navigation

> Transition map

> Maybe I could find a way to embed the framer navigation prototype on the website, that’d be cool.

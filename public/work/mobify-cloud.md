Mobify Cloud is a responsive web application translated into multiple languages, servicing users in several countries. It functions as a development team management interface, as well as a production testing and deployment platform. I've worked on a multitude of features and improvements, ranging from high-level product direction and user research, to UI design and front-end implementation.

## User Research

Collecting information about your users isn't enough to make good product decisions, you also need a way of storing that information for later reference, and analysis.

We havent always had a system for collecting feedback from users at Mobify, it  was an often debated topic. Our feedback was scattered, unsearchable, and not helping us make better product decisions.

Mobify Cloud is a responsive web application translated into multiple languages, servicing users in several countries. It functions as a development team management interface, as well as a production testing and deployment platform for mobile web experiences. I've worked on a multitude of features and improvements, ranging from high-level product direction and user research, to UI design and front-end implementation.

## Understanding Our Users

I want to talk about how were a product company that has a client services side but we also have partner companies also using our software. When conducting our user research we needed to make sure we were accounting for all those different types of people. Teams of varying size, skill level, devices, and workflows.

I conducted multiple user interviews to build out a list of common problems and workflows. These informed our user archetypes, and then created personas from them. We use the personas to help drive our design decisions.

[TODO need to design a compelling way to show some visuals here]

## Colour Refresh

[This should show before and after screenshots of the interface, maybe a swiping effect, showing one image and scrubbing between them]

## UI Design Process

In this section I'll describe my modular UI design process briefly and show off the changes from the UI Colour Palette refresh.

Also show a carousel of screens, from publishing, to login, to orgs.

## Mobify Preview

I'll show off Mobify Preview in a gif. Talking about what went into the design of it.

Mobify Cloud is a responsive web application translated into multiple languages, servicing users in several countries. It functions as a development team management interface, as well as a production testing and deployment platform. I've worked on a multitude of features and improvements, ranging from high-level product direction and user research, to UI design and front-end implementation.

## User Research

The one part  of our user research, and one I can actually show, is our personas. I conducted multiple user interviews to build out a list of user archetypes, and then created personas from them. We use the personas to help drive our design decisions.

## UI Design

In this section I'll describe my modular UI design process briefly and show off the changes from the UI Colour Palette refresh.

Also show a carousel of screens, from publishing, to login, to orgs.

## Mobify Preview

I'll show off Mobify Preview in a gif. Talking about what went into the design of it.

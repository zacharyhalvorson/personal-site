Mobify Cloud is a responsive web application translated into multiple languages, and used across several countries. It’s the primary customer portal for Mobify customers with many functions. It serves as a development team management interface, as well as a production testing and deployment platform for mobile experiences. I've worked on a multitude of features and improvements, ranging from conducting user research to high-level product direction, UI design and front-end implementation.

## Understanding Our Users

Mobify makes software that gives web development teams the ability to adapt desktop websites for mobile devices, enhancing user experience and performance. In addition to an amazing team of in-house designers and engineers doing implementations for customer websites, we also have partner organizations that do web implementations using our software. 

I often led user research activities for Mobify Cloud. I conducted interviews, crafted surveys, and organized inbound feedback, for both our internal team as well as external delivery partners. We often found a wide array of skill sets and workflows among the users and teams that used Mobify’s software to deliver for customers.

Keeping this information organized and indexed was key to making better product decisions. I distilled data from interviews and surveys into personas for use in product design decision-making, and I also created a database for quickly searching through inbound feedback from users, using a <a class=“c-link” href=“http://alistapart.com/article/connected-ux”>shared Evernote notebook</a> hooked up to our main feedback email address.

## Colour Refresh

[This should show before and after screenshots of the interface, maybe a swiping effect, showing one image and scrubbing between them]

## UI Design Process

In this section I'll describe my modular UI design process briefly and show off the changes from the UI Colour Palette refresh.

Also show a carousel of screens, from publishing, to login, to orgs.

## Mobify Preview

I'll show off Mobify Preview in a gif. Talking about what went into the design of it.

            p Mobify is a Vancouver-based SaaS company with a platform focused on mobile customer engagement across web and native apps. The platform is currently being used to power some of the webâ€™s most active mobile eCommerce experiences such as Pure Formulas, Think Geek, Garmin, Bose and more.
            p I started at Mobify as a co-op, and have since filled several positions. My work there has included:
            ul
                li Product design for a mobile project testing and release console. The work extended from interaction design, and prototyping, to front-end development.
                li Product design for a customer engagement platform that included location-based marketing, and behaviour-driven web and app push notification delivery.
                li iOS and Android app design for our hybrid app development framework, as well as several client builds.
                li Building relationships with the partner developer network, customers, and in-house development teams. Facilitating user testing, interviews, and gathering feedback on our platform.

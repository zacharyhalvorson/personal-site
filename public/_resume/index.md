## Experience
### Mobify
- Product Designer
- February 2014 - Current

[Mobify](http://www.mobify.com) is a Vancouver-based SaaS company with a platform focused on mobile customer engagement across web and native apps. The platform is currently being used to power some of the webâ€™s most active mobile eCommerce experiences such as Pure Formulas, Think Geek, Garmin, Bose and more.

I started at Mobify as a co-op, and have since filled several positions. My work there has included:

- Product design for a mobile project testing and release console. The work extended from interaction design, and prototyping, to front-end development.
- Product design for a customer engagement platform that included location-based marketing, and behaviour-driven web and app push notification delivery.
- iOS and Android app design for our hybrid app development framework, as well as several client builds.
- Building relationships with the partner developer network, customers, and in-house development teams. Facilitating user testing, interviews, and gathering feedback on our platform.

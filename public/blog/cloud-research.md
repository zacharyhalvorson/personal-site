Collecting information about your users isn't enough to make good product decisions, you also need a way of storing that information for later reference, and analysis.

We havent always had a system for collecting feedback from users at Mobify, it  was an often debated topic. Our feedback was scattered, unsearchable, and not helping us make better product decisions.

This wasnt a problem of not enough feedback from our users, it was that we didnt have a place to easily put it. A lot of our communication with users was via email, so I decided a system that worked with email would be the right experience. <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/connected-ux">This post</a> from A List Apart gave us what we needed.

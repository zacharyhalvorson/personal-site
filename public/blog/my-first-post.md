Personal websites are hard. Everyone's got a drawer full of redesigns, and the guilty feeling that comes from unfinished work. There’s been plenty written about how we should just use the popular tools, like Squarespace or Medium, because the idea of a personal site or blog is a solved problem. I’m not sure I can subscribe to that though - a personal site is a chance to have a dialogue with yourself. Understand your own taste and give yourself the space to experiment and grow.

## Where do I start?

Too many times have I started with a mood board, or even mocks, before I've even written a single word. So this time I'm starting with a post. This one in particular.

Any project worth doing starts with content. You need to establish your intent before you can start any meaningful work. So through this project, I’ve kept writing content as my first priority. Hashing out what I want to say before I build the place for it to live.

## What is this site going to be for?

I'm looking for a place to write down my thoughts as I work on new projects, learn new development techniques, develop as a writer, and grow as a Designer. In my work on the product team at Mobify I’m often working on longer term projects with a lot of different people, this blog can give me the chance to share the little pieces I work on as I go.

## How have I built it?

After I had written the majority of the content I set out in design and development with a few constraints:
* The blog posts should be pure markdown. I want to be able to contribute as easily as possible. 
* 

I'm starting with the content, write the pages first then think about overall structure. I've got a bit of a list:
- Some kind of interactive home page for new experiments.
- My personal projects, like Curriculate, and Sundown.
- A sharply curated list of my work at Mobify.
- A starting blog post (like this one), with an intention for more.
- An about page, so people can get to know my background, what I get excited about, and what kinds of things I'd like to work on.
- I want to keep my content in markdown as much as possible. Seperating the content from formal markup as much as possible. This will help me move content and write more easily.

I will start by writing the pages. With annotations for imagery and any interactive bits. I have a decent structure in place from my previous website, so things like pagination and navigation structure will just mimic what I've done before.

Writing the content will have to include gathering up the imagery as well, so I'll be looking back over my various before and after screenshots and whatever I can get together to document progress and polish.

I'm developing with harp.js, and hosting it on surge.sh. This will allow me to quickly deploy new changes. I previously had been using github pages, which was great but also introduced this extra deployment step, as I wasn't able to have my build files living anywhere but the root directory. This surge process will keep things clean, and fast. Plus its a local OS project, I love what they're doing.

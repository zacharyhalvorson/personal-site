## What’s this post really about?

I’m trying to write about this site. Particularly why and how i made the thing. It should offer a glimpse into why I think personal sites are a good thing for designers on the web. There’s an argument for why people should just use Medium or whatever to blog with, this is a chance for me to talk about why I don’t really like that. Although.. Do I really believe that? I’m not quite sure. I should probably write about the two different perspectives.

* Why a personal site at all?
* Why a blog?
* What was my process
* The writing-first approach.
* The decision to redesign my existing site.
* Having to go back to it after a few days away.

Personal websites are hard. Everyone's got a drawer full of redesigns, and a guilty feeling around now getting them done. There’s been plenty written about how we should focus out design skills on our user’s problems, or just use the popular tools of the day because the idea of a personal site or blog is a solved problem. I’m not sure I can subscribe to that though.

A personal site is a chance to have a dialogue with yourself. Understand your own 

Personal websites are fun though, they give you a place to experiment and try new things. That's why I made this one.

## Where do I start?

Too many times have I started with a mood board, or even mocks, before I've even written a single word. So this time I'm starting with a post. This one in particular.

Any project worth doing starts with content. You need to establish your intent before you can start any rendering. Too many times have I started with a mood board before I've even written a single word. So this time I'm starting with this post. Describe what I'm going to build and why.

## What is this site going to be for?

I'm looking for a place to write down my thoughts as I work on new projects, learn new development techniques, develop as a writer, and grow as a Designer. Sharing what you learn is important, and a personal website gives me a chance to both share and experiment. Grow and give back.

So this site will help people know me better as a designer, understand what I've worked on in the past, and what I'd like to work on in the future. But I'd also like a place to write, and experiment.

## How am I going to build it?

I'm starting with the content, write the pages first then think about overall structure. I've got a bit of a list:
- Some kind of interactive home page for new experiments.
- My personal projects, like Curriculate, and Sundown.
- A sharply curated list of my work at Mobify.
- A starting blog post (like this one), with an intention for more.
- An about page, so people can get to know my background, what I get excited about, and what kinds of things I'd like to work on.
- I want to keep my content in markdown as much as possible. Seperating the content from formal markup as much as possible. This will help me move content and write more easily.

I will start by writing the pages. With annotations for imagery and any interactive bits. I have a decent structure in place from my previous website, so things like pagination and navigation structure will just mimic what I've done before.

Writing the content will have to include gathering up the imagery as well, so I'll be looking back over my various before and after screenshots and whatever I can get together to document progress and polish.

I'm developing with harp.js, and hosting it on surge.sh. This will allow me to quickly deploy new changes. I previously had been using github pages, which was great but also introduced this extra deployment step, as I wasn't able to have my build files living anywhere but the root directory. This surge process will keep things clean, and fast. Plus its a local OS project, I love what they're doing.

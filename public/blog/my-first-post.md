Personal websites are hard. Everyone's got a drawer full of redesigns, and the guilty feeling that comes from unfinished work. There’s been plenty written about how we should just use the popular tools, like Squarespace or Medium, they say the idea of a personal site or blog is a solved problem, I’m not sure I can subscribe to that though. A personal site is a chance to have a dialogue with yourself, understand your own taste, and give yourself the space to experiment and grow.

## Where do I start?

Too many times have I started with a mood board, or mocks, before I've even written a single word. So this time I'm starting with a post. This one in particular.

Any project worth doing starts with content. You need to establish your intent before you can start any meaningful work. So through this project, I’ve kept writing as my first priority. Hashing out what I want to say before I build the place for it to live.

## What is this site going to be for?

I'm looking for a place to write down my thoughts as I work on new projects, learn new development techniques, develop as a writer, and grow as a Designer. In my work on the product team at Mobify I’m often working on longer term projects with a lot of different people, this blog can give me the chance to share the little pieces I work on as I go.

## How have I built it?

I'm developing with harp.js, and hosting it on surge.sh. This will allow me to quickly deploy new changes. I previously had been using github pages, which was great but also introduced this extra deployment step, as I wasn't able to have my build files living anywhere but the root directory (long story). This surge process will keep things clean, and fast. Plus its a local OS project, I love what they're doing.

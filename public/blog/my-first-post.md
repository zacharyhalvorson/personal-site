# My personal site redesign

Personal websites are hard. Everyone's got a drawer full of redesigns and guilt over not contributing to it more. Personal websites are fun though, they give you a place to experiment and try new things. That's why I made this one.

## Where do I start?

> "Design is the rendering of intent."

Any project worth doing starts with content. You need to establish your intent before you can start any rendering. Too many times have I started with a mood board before I've even written a single word. So this time I'm starting with this post. Describe what I'm going to build and why.

## What is this site going to be for?

I'm looking for a place to write down my thoughts as I work on new projects, learn new development techniques, develop as a writer, and grow as a Designer. Sharing what you learn is important, and a personal website gives me a chance to both share and experiment. Grow and give back.

So this site will help people know me better as a designer, understand what I've worked on in the past, and what I'd like to work on in the future. But I'd also like a place to write, and experiment.

## How am I going to build it?

I'm starting with the content, mapping out what all needs to be here. I've got a bit of a list:
- Some kind of interactive home page for new experiments.
- My personal projects, like Curriculate, and Sundown.
- A sharply curated list of my work at Mobify.
- A starting blog post (like this one), with an intention for more.
- An about page, so people can get to know my background, what I get excited about, and what kinds of things I'd like to work on.

I will start by writing the content. With annotations for imagery and any interactive bits. I have a decent structure in place from my previous website, so things like pagination and navigation structure will just mimick what I've done before.

Writing the content will have to include gathering up the imagery as well, so I'll be looking back over my various before and after screenshots and whatever I can get together to document progress and polish.

I'm developing with harp.js, and hosting it on surge.sh. This will allow me to quickly deploy new changes. I previously had been using github pages, which was great but also introduced this extra deployment step, as I wasnt able to have my build files living anywhere but the root directory. This surge process will keep things clean, and fast. Plus its a local OS project, I love what they're doing.

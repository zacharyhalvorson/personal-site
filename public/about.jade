        p ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m a designer whoâ€™s focussed on digital interaction, and product design. Iâ€™ve worked on both web and native applications, and relish an opportunity to see a product through from research to implementation. I'm currently making things with the product team at <a class="c-link" href="http://www.mobify.com" target="_blank">Mobify</a>.

        p Hi, I’m Zach. I’m a designer with a focus on digital interaction and product design. I dabble in both web and apps, furthering my passion for clean, and considered solutions. I’m currently making things with the Product Team at <a href="http://www.mobify.com" target="_blank">Mobify</a>.
        p I enjoy design, programming, music, and complaining about things. Here’s where I usually go to do stuff like that:
        ul
            li: a(href='http://www.twitter.com/#{author.twitter}') twitter
            li: a(href='http://www.github.com/#{author.github}') github
            li: a(href='http://www.rdio.com/people/#{author.rdio}') rdio
            li: a(href='https://dribbble.com/#{author.dribbble}') dribbble

    p Hi, I’m Zach. I’m a designer with a focus on digital interaction design. I dabble in both web and iOS, furthering my passion for clean, and considered solutions. I’m currently making things with the Product Team at Mobify here in Vancouver, but I’m always up for a chat, particularly over a coffee/beer.
    p I enjoy design, programming, music,  and complaining about things. Here’s where I usually go to do stuff like that:
    ul
        li: a(href='http://www.twitter.com/#{author.twitter}') twitter
        li: a(href='http://www.github.com/#{author.github}') github
        li: a(href='http://www.rdio.com/people/#{author.rdio}') rdio

        h2 Overview
        p ðŸ‘‹ Hello from Vancouver. Iâ€™m a designer whoâ€™s focussed on product design. Iâ€™ve worked on both web and native applications, and relish an opportunity to see a project through  from research all the way to implementation. I'm currently working on the product team at <a class="c-link" href="http://mobify.com">Mobify</a>.

        h2 Work Inquiries
        p Iâ€™m interested in partnerships for side projects, or smaller freelance projects. Drop me a line if youâ€™re interested!

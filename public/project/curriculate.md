My background in teaching has motivated me to begin work on this project. It's a tool for planning, managing and sharing lesson plans. I started with the idea and went from there, asking myself all the Why questions I could before starting to sketch.

And here's some kittens.

### Information Architecture

From sketches I began to create a userflow and wireframes.

Once the IA/Wireframing process was complete I started with the visual design process, originally starting with an iPad-centric experience in mind.

### Design

I eventually decided to go with a more responsive approach and design for a web app. The following iterations brought me to the final mockups I have begun to use for the prototype development.

The project is still early in the development stage, I'll hopefully have something live linked here soon.

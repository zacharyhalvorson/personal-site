It&#39;s a tool for planning, managing and sharing lesson plans. I started with the idea and went from there, asking myself all the Why questions I could before starting to sketch.</p>
<p>And here&#39;s some kittens.</p>

<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
<p>From sketches I began to create a userflow and wireframes.</p>
<p>Once the IA/Wireframing process was complete I started with the visual design process, originally starting with an iPad-centric experience in mind.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>I eventually decided to go with a more responsive approach and design for a web app. The following iterations brought me to the final mockups I have begun to use for the prototype development.</p>
<p>The project is still early in the development stage, I&#39;ll hopefully have something live linked here soon.</p>

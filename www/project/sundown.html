The user is kept apprised of how many minutes away the sunset is based on their location and, at a specified time, play a pre-organized sunset-themed playlist. The music is streamed through the user&#39;s existing Rdio account, defaulting to pre-defined Sundown playlists.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The interface is meant to compliment but not distract from the beautiful sunset the users are meant to be enjoying. The darker background more relaxing to read in dark light, no one wants a face full of white light while they&#39;re trying to appreciate a beautiful sunset.</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>I plan to continue to develop this app as a free web app, open to any Rdio users with an option for non-Rdio users to try it out as a guest with 30 second previews of songs. The app itself will be strictly for small screens and feature a login with Rdio.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve gotten as far as a preliminary prototype below, it&#39;s missing a music player and a log in but the sunset timer works just fine. Also bear in mine it is made for a small screen.</p>

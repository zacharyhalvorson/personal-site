Personal Site
==========================

I built this site to give people an idea of what I've worked on in the past and have a place to experiment and dabble in front-end things. 

Currently, the way Github Pages work, all the compiled assets have to be in the root folder so in the interest of not pulluting the source code I've kept all the pre-compiled code in the `Development` branch. Have a look there if you're interesed. I built this site using Jade and Stylus with [Harp js](harpjs.com).
